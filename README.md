# kurobot

its just some fun project:
What can it do:

1) Post memes
2) post inspiring images (well, sometimes)

What can you do:

1) Submit memes to be added to the database
2) Do the same with insults.

collaborators are appreciated. If someone wants to join, just let me know. Its a pure fun project to learn and work with
the Java discord library "JDA"
# Disclaimer
This bot currently demands Admin permissions for being added. 
This is simply to allow me as developer to play around as much as I please. 
If there will ever be a function added that would change anything about the server I
guarantee to make it so that it can only be invoked
by the owner of said server.

Simply add the bot to your server by clicking
